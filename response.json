Stimulation may involve the use of hands, everyday objects, sex toys, or more rarely, the mouth (autofellatio and autocunnilingus). Masturbation may also be performed with a sex partner, either masturbating together or watching the other partner masturbate, and this is known as \"mutual masturbation\".\nMasturbation is frequent in both sexes. Various medical and psychological benefits have been attributed to a healthy attitude toward sexual activity in general and to masturbation in particular. No causal relationship between masturbation and any form of mental or physical disorder has been found. Masturbation is considered by clinicians to be a healthy, normal part of sexual enjoyment.  The only exceptions to \"masturbation causes no harm\" are certain cases of Peyronie's disease and hard flaccid syndrome.\nMasturbation has been depicted in art since prehistoric times, and is both mentioned and discussed in very early writings. Religions vary in their views of masturbation. In the 18th and 19th centuries, some European theologians and physicians described it in negative terms, but during the 20th century, these taboos generally declined. There has been an increase in discussion and portrayal of masturbation in art, popular music, television, films, and literature. The legal status of masturbation has also varied through history, and masturbation in public is illegal in most countries. Masturbation in non-human animals has been observed both in the wild and captivity.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word masturbation was introduced in the 18th century, based on the Latin verb masturbari, alongside the slightly earlier onanism.\nThe Latin verb masturbari is of uncertain origin. Suggested derivations include an unattested word for penis, *mazdo, cognate with Greek μέζεα mézea 'genitals', or alternatively a corruption of an unattested *manu stuprare (\"to defile with the hand\"), by association with turbare 'to disturb'.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nWhile masturbation is the formal word for this practice, many other expressions are in common use. Terms such as playing with oneself, pleasuring oneself and slang such as wanking, jerking off, jacking off, fapping and frigging are common. Self-abuse and self-pollution were common in early modern times and are still found in modern dictionaries. A large variety of other euphemisms and dysphemisms exist which describe masturbation. For a list of terms, see the entry for masturbate in Wiktionary.\n\n\n== Techniques ==\n\n\n=== General ===\nMasturbation involves touching, pressing, rubbing, or massaging one's own genital area with the hands, fingers, or against an object such as a pillow; inserting fingers or an object into the vagina or anus (see anal masturbation); and stimulating the penis or vulva with an electric vibrator, which may also be inserted into the vagina or anus. It may also involve touching, rubbing, or pinching the nipples or other erogenous zones while masturbating. Both sexes sometimes apply lubricants to reduce friction.\n\nReading or viewing pornography, sexual fantasies, or other erotic stimuli may lead to a desire for sexual release such as by masturbation. Pornography is also used to assist with masturbation and to improve the experience of masturbating. Some people get sexual pleasure by inserting objects, such as urethral sounds, into the urethra (the tube through which urine and, in men, semen, flows), a practice known as urethral play or \"sounding\". Other objects such as ball point pens and thermometers are sometimes used, although this practice can lead to injury or infection. Some people use sex machines to simulate intercourse.\nMen and women may masturbate until they are close to orgasm, stop for a while to reduce excitement, and then resume masturbating. They may repeat this cycle multiple time[{\"url\":\"https://wakeup.sg/pabna-man-mutilates-himself/\",\"title\":\"Man Cuts Off Own Genitals After Family Pushes Marriage\",\"content\":\"The victim, Nazmul Hossain, 22, is currently undergoing treatment at Pabna General Hospital after allegedly chopping off his own genitalia in a moment of\",\"score\":0.8488849,\"raw_content\":null},{\"url\":\"https://gulfnews.com/world/gulf/saudi/saudi-man-cuts-off-genital-after-blocked-marriage-plans-1.569368\",\"title\":\"Saudi man cuts off genital after blocked marriage plans\",\"content\":\"Saudi man cuts off genital after blocked marriage plans ...
